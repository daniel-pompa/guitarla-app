# GuitarLA - Online Guitar Store

GuitarLA is a demo project showcasing the design and functionality of a shopping cart system within an online guitar store context. While the site includes a static page displaying guitar models, the primary focus is on the development and demonstration of the shopping cart feature, rather than creating a fully operational eCommerce platform.
